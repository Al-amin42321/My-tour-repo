    <h3>A Tour In Sylhet</h3>
    <p>sylhet is one of the most beautiful places in Bangladesh. It's a place of natural beauty. Sylhet is widely known
        for having tea gardens and hills. It is also a holy place as it is known as the place of 360 awlias(saints).
        Last year I got the opportunity to go to Sylhet. I visited Sylhet with my family. We went there by train. I sat
        beside the window and enjoy the scenes through the window. I was overwhelmed by the natural scenes. After seven
        hours long journey, we reached Sylhet. We visited all the places of tourist attractions like- Jaflong which is
        near the Indian border, Ratargul swamp forest, Lauachara forest, and Tangua Haor. We spent five days in Sylhet.
        I enjoyed each and every moments of my Sylhet tour.</p>
